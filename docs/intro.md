# Programming Languages For RL Engineers

The first practice project for the RL Tools group is a toy programming language. The first question that could come to mind is "Why?" 

The simple answer, all AI is built using the principles. To make the next heavy steps in the industry, we'll need to incorporate. Libraries like TF and Pytorch use the principles from PL to give programmers access to deep learning. It's so well built, that you don't normally see or think about it. The libraries create compute graphs, which determine training. The same is true when determining actions relative to the state.

One of the primary goals is to prove that RL can be built using the same principles used in AI. It's just a mix of NLP (graphs) and computing (interpretation).

Ultimately it'll help to know the fundamentals as we're building and experimenting with multiple kinds of systems out there. But wait. **There's an even bigger reason than that. You'll become a very strong programmer.**

**Think about it your journey.** You must master recursion, dynamic arrays, trees, graphs, and hash tables. You probably use hash tables at least in your day-to-day programming, but do you really understand them? Well, after we’ve crafted our own from scratch, I guarantee you will. Rise to it, and you’ll come away as a stronger programmer.
